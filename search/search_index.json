(Please let me know) Features \u00b6 Finding mugs Connecting to Mugs Reading Information (Colour, temp, liquid level, etc.) Polling for changes Usage \u00b6 Python \u00b6 from ember_mug.scanner import find_mug , discover_mugs from ember_mug.mug import EmberMug # if first time with mug in pairing mugs = await discover_mugs () device = mugs [ 0 ] # after paired you can simply use device = await find_mug () mug = EmberMug ( device ) async with mug . connection () as con : print ( 'Connected. \\n Fetching Info' ) await con . update_all () print ( mug . formatted_data ) CLI \u00b6 It can also be invoked as a module from command line as python -m ember_mug --help . There are four options with different subsections. You can see them by specifying them before help. eg python -m ember_mug poll --help python -m ember_mug discover # Finds the mug in pairing mode for the first time python -m ember_mug poll # fetches info and keeps listening for notifications Basic options: Command Use discover Find/List all detected unpaired mugs in pairing mode find Find one already paired mugs info Connect to one mug and print its current state poll Connect to one mug and print its current state and keep watching for changes Caveats \u00b6 Since this api is not public, a lot of guesswork and reverse engineering is involved, so it's not perfect. Only works with one mug at a time These mugs do not broadcast data unless paired. So you can only have one device connected to it. You need to reset them to change to another device and make sure the previous device doesn't try to reconnect. Reading data from the mug seems to work pretty well, but I have been unable to write to it so far... I always get NotPermitted errors. I haven't figured out some attributes like udsk, dsk, location, Credits \u00b6 This package was created with Cookiecutter and the waynerv/cookiecutter-pypackage project template.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#python-ember-mug","text":"Python Library for Ember Mugs Documentation: https://sopelj.github.io/python-ember-mug GitHub: https://github.com/sopelj/python-ember-mug PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/python-ember-mug/ Free software: MIT","title":"Python Ember Mug"},{"location":"#summary","text":"Library to attempt to interact with Ember Mugs via Bluetooth using the bleak library.

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. You can contribute in many ways: Types of Contributions \u00b6 Report Bugs \u00b6 Report bugs at https://github.com/sopelj/python-ember-mug/issues. If you are reporting a bug, please include: Your operating system name and version. Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting. Detailed steps to reproduce the bug. Fix Bugs \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Implement Features \u00b6 Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Write Documentation \u00b6 Python Ember Mug could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Python Ember Mug docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback \u00b6 The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/sopelj/python-ember-mug/issues. If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :) Get Started! \u00b6 Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up python-ember-mug for local development. Fork the python-ember-mug repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/python-ember-mug.git Ensure poetry is installed. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv: $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev Create a branch for local development: $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox: $ poetry run tox Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md. The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Check https://github.com/sopelj/python-ember-mug/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Tips \u00b6 $ poetry run pytest tests/test_python_ember_mug.py To run a subset of tests. Deploying \u00b6 A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md). Then run: $ poetry run bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch $ git push $ git push --tags GitHub Actions will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
